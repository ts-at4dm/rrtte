        <p>
            The "Mission": To bring to awareness to the lack of access to technology and education (of the sorts) within the prison systems in the United States whether it be state or federal level, and the need to provide these resources to incarcerated individuals to give them a fighting chance upon release in hopes of reducing recidivism rates.

                <h1>The Digital Divide</h1>
                <p>
                    There is a significant divide between incarcerated individuals, technology and education in many prison systems across the United States. Although it has been proven that technology has played a significant role in reducing recidivism rates, it has also been used to create barriers and divide communities. "The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to technology and the skills to use it, compared to those who do not. Many correctional facilities restrict or completely deny inmates access to the web due to security concerns, limiting their ability to engage in online activities, education, and communication." - <a href="https://communitytechnetwork.org/">Community Tech Net</a>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This divide leads to a significant loss of trust in the institutions that are supposed to be rehabilitating these individuals in order for them to be ready to re-enter society. Not only that but give these people a chance at success after incarceration. It has also led to an increase in recidivism rates, which in turn leads to increased prison populations and overcrowding. Individuals who are denied access to technology and education are less likely to seek out new jobs, seek out professional help, or seek out help from their friends and family. There is also a major divide between what society requires of these individuals upon release and the people in charge of these institutions. A lot of facilities and Departments throughout the U.S are currently still employing individuals and putting them in positions of power at these institutions that have a "they're just prisoners, who cares?" mentality. And before we can start to see real change, that's something that needs to be addressed first. How do I know this you might ask? Because I've personally witnessed it. And once upon a time, I to had that same mentality.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I have personally witnessed and experienced this divide firsthand from serving my own time as an incarcerated individual within the Maine prison system. Although I've been fortunate to have access to the tools and education for most of my sentence, it didn’t start out that way. I had to earn and work my way to into it. But I have witnessed others who have spent far more time in than I have, not have this luxury. I have witnessed people who have spent decades in prison and not have access to technology that we have today, be let out and not have a single idea of how to run today’s modern cell phone, laptop, tablet or even the internet itself. I have also witnessed people who have taken the initiative to want to learn about said tech to help better themselves and prepare for their release.   
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now you may be saying to yourself, "Why would some not have access but others do?" Well, it could be a number of factors. Anything from the crimes the person is convicted of, their behavior while incarcerated or just the sheer lack of willingness to learn. In Maine, there is only two ways to gain computer access. One is through enrolling in classes through either a university or other higher level educational means, or for re-entry purposes. And for that to happen, you need to be at least 90 days from your release date. The only way to obtain a laptop is to be enrolled in post-secondary education. At least in Maine, the Department of Corrections has made it a point to try and model their entire system after the country of Norway’s Prison System and give residents the tools and know how to succeed and reduce their chances of recidivism after their release. Now that being said, and this is my opinion, there is far more that could be added to the model but to be completely honest, they're doing a decent job compared to the majority of prisons throughout the United States.

                <h1>Internet in Prison</h1>
                <p>
                    In an article by Christopher Zoukis of <a href="https://federalcriminaldefenseattorney.com/internet-access-is-a-human-right-should-prisoners-have-it/">Zoukis Consulting Group</a>, Christopher states that in 2011 the United Nations declared internet access a basic human right at this point. He goes on to say that although it’s a nonbinding resolution, it reflects the essential nature of the internet, and how fundamental it is to our everyday being. Allowing internet access could give prisoners the opportunity to broaden perspectives, connect with the wider world in meaningful ways, and learn essential skills that exist in the world waiting for them upon release. It could also grant them access to important learning resources including college and vocational courses and language skills. The internet is a useful tool for self-improvement.
                </p>
                <br>
            </div>
            <div id="s2d2">
                <p>
                    Understandably, there are concerns about why this should not happen. Some in the prison systems are not guaranteed to use the concept for what its actual purpose is. "A potential free-for-all that could give rise to an increase in contraband, access to pornography, threats to victims or engagement in digital crimes. But these fears should be tempered by the fact that digital technologies can be custom tailored for each purpose, and access to them strictly monitored and controlled in secure environments." For example, sites fitting certain types of criteria like financial institutions, pornography and other illegal activity access can easily be blocked. There is advanced software available for today’s systems that can allow active monitoring of individuals down to the very key they press as well as instant remote access as well. And for the ones who abuse these systems, they should be held accountable and disciplined respectfully. Let them ruin it for themselves, not the entire community.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Now I'm not saying that starting out, incarcerated individual individuals should be given access to a computer and internet without having a purpose behind it. I agree with the general concept of how my state is providing this opportunity. Residents should be participating in educational courses and or be enrolled in school. But they should also have access to "some" entertainment. For example, YouTube. YouTube is a great resource for educational purposes as well as occasional entertainment. YouTube offers restricted versions of itself to help keep people from looking at things they shouldn’t. There are so many different possibilities and unlimited potential to learn just by watching content.

                <h1>Statistics & Conclusion</h1>
                <p>According to the <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2022-statistical-tables#:~:text=Findings%20are%20based%20on%20BJS's,from%20yearend%202021%20(1%2C205%2C100).">Bureau of Justice Statistics</a>, The U.S prison population was 1,230,100 at yearend 2022, a 2% increase from yearend 2021 (1,205,100).<a href="https://www.nsin.us/us-crime-police-and-prisons/#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20the%20U.S.%20prison,share%20of%20the%20general%20population.">NSIN</a>, "In 2024, the U.S. prison population stands at over 1.9 million individuals across various facilities. Racial disparities persist, with Black and Hispanic individuals overrepresented compared to their share of the general population". That's a 54.47% increase from the end of 2022.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The sad part of all this is that the US Department of Justice statistics puts recidivism rates in roughly 24 states to be that of 84%. Ex-Offenders who complete some high school courses have recidivism rates of around 55%. vocational trainings cut recidivism to approximately 30%. An associates degree drops the rate to 13.7% and a bachelor's degree reduces it to 5.6%. - <a href="https://federalcriminaldefenseattorney.com/prison-education-facts/prison-education-reduces-recidivism/">Zoukis Consulting Group</a>  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Allowing residents access to something as simple as a laptop or even a Desktop Computer in a controlled environment opens up numerous opportunities. Residents should have the same educational opportunities as someone on the street has. There shouldn’t be a limitation to what degrees are available to someone who is incarcerated just because they are in prison. States like Maine & New Hampshire have what is called a PEP or "Prisoner Education Program". This program helps students who are incarcerated in becoming enrolled in colleges or universities through online means and sometimes even in person classes. Individuals who are incarcerated become eligible for what is called a PELL Grant. As of July 2023, incarcerated individuals can again access Pell Grants to help pay for approved PEPs. The only downside is that the school that they wish to attend needs to be a part of a PEP. This is where the awareness comes into play. This is a significant policy change after a nearly 30-year ban that made it difficult for people in prison to pursue higher education. The ban was lifted after federal legislation was passed in 2020 to restore Pell funding to incarcerated individuals by fall 2023. There are also many scholarships out there specifically for incarcerated or formally incarcerated individuals. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, society as a whole needs to do better at changing it's outlook on individuals who are or were incarcerated at one point in their life. Over the last few years, you see it happening but not at the pace it needs too. It has been statistically proven that access to education and technology while in prison significantly reduces an individual's likelihood of re-offending which in turn lowers crime rates, provides safer communities and an overall better life for the individual and society as a whole.
